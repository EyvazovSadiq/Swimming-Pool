# Swimming-Pool

The Swimming Pool System is a web application where you can do operations related to the management of a swimming pool.

## How it works

You can register new swimmer(or delete registered swimmer) in the system. After that, the person pays money for a month and you provide him with a client card where there are limited usage permissions according to the paid money. When the swimmer uses his card, the system automatically decreases his usage balance. In addition, you can see the list of swimmers, payments, and entrances in which time which swimmer used his card. When the balance of swimmer is less than 2, system warns about it. Moreover, there is only one admin and workers to use this application. And only admin can register new workers to use the application.
